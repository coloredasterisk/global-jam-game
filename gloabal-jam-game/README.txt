How we used our code:

We constructed a script named gridComponent amd gridManager to help construct a grid and to translate all other 
assets onto the editor and to manipulate their properties. Then we constructed every interactable asset and made sure they worked 
individually before adding more properties to connect the assets together so they can interact with each other using the
grid component. After constructing all the interactive objects for our game, we could easily drag our assets onto the unity editor
and use the grid componenet and grid manager to construct and track of the stages.
